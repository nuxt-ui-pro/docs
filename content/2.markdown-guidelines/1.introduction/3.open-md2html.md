## Document Development

## Conversion Steps
The conversion is done in three different steps:
* Step 1 - Prepare an archive
* Step 2 - Upload archive
* Step 3 - Obtain the URL to converted documents

## Step 1: Prepare an Archive
* We recommend storing your document in GitHub as it is easy to download the content from any particular branch.
* Please ensure that the size of your archive is less than 10 MB.


## Step 2: Upload Archive
* You MUST upload an archive folder to the <a href="https://open-md2html.rubystream.info/" target="_blank">open-MD2HTML</a>.

## Step 3: Obtain URL
* The tool will convert your markdown content into a PDF and HTML.
* The content in the URL will be available for 72 hours. After that period, it will be deleted.
