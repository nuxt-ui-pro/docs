## Links

To create a link, wrap the link text in brackets `[]()`.

::code-preview{class="[&>div]:*:my-0"}

#code

```mdc

### Links to other pages

Links to other pages of your documentation needs to be root-relative. For example, if you have a page called `getting-started/installation`, the link to that page should be `[Installation](/getting-started/installation)`.

::code-preview{class="[&>div]:*:my-0"}

[Installation](/getting-started/installation)

#code

```mdc
[Installation](/getting-started/installation)
```
