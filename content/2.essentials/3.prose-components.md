### Accordion

Use the `accordion` and `accordion-item` components to display an [Accordion](https://ui3.nuxt.dev/components/accordion) in your content.

::code-preview{class="[&>div]:*:my-0"}

:::accordion

::accordion-item{label="What are the main considerations when upgrading to Nuxt UI v3?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
The transition to v3 involves significant changes, including new component structures, updated theming approaches, and revised TypeScript definitions. We recommend a careful, incremental upgrade process, starting with thorough testing in a development environment.
::

::accordion-item{label="Is Nuxt UI v3 compatible with standalone Vue projects?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Nuxt UI is now compatible with Vue! You can follow the [installation guide](/getting-started/installation) to get started.
::

::accordion-item{label="What about Nuxt UI Pro?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
We've also rebuilt Nuxt UI Pro from scratch and released a `v3.0.0-alpha.x` package but it only contains the components to build this documentation yet. This will be a free update, so the license you buy now will be valid for v3. We're actively working to finish the rewrite of all Nuxt UI Pro components.

### Badge

Use markdown in the default slot of the `badge` component to display a [Badge](/components/badge) in your content.

::code-preview{label="Preview"}

:::badge
**v3.0.0-alpha.10**
:::

#code

```mdc
::badge
**v3.0.0-alpha.10**
::
```

::

### Callout

Use markdown in the default slot of the `callout` component to add eye-catching context to your content.

Use the `icon` and `color` props to customize it. You can also pass any property from the [`<NuxtLink>`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/nuxt-link) component.

::code-preview{class="[&>div]:*:my-0 [&>div]:*:w-full"}

::callout
This is a `callout` with full **markdown** support.
::

#code

```mdc
::callout
This is a `callout` with full **markdown** support.
::
```

::

You can also use the `note`, `tip`, `warning` and `caution` shortcuts with pre-defined icons and colors.

::code-preview{label="Preview"}

:::div{class="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full"}

::note{class="w-full my-0"}
Here's some additional information for you.
::

::tip{class="w-full my-0"}
Here's a helpful suggestion.
::

::warning{class="w-full my-0"}
Be careful with this action as it might have unexpected results.
::

::caution{class="w-full my-0"}
This action cannot be undone.
